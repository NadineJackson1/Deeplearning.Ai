# Deeplearning.Ai

This is my playground as I work my way through the Deeplearning.Ai Tensorflow Developer Professional Certificate.


What I am learning:

Best practices for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for a computer vision applications.

How to handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.

How to build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.

    Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs as you train them using text repositories.

Skills gained:

    Computer Vision
    Convolutional Neural Network
    Machine Learning
    Natural Language Processing
    Tensorflow
    Inductive Transfer
    Augmentation
    Dropouts
    Tokenization
    RNNs
    Forecasting
    Time Series


TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. 

In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program, I'm learning the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. 


In this DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program, I'm getting hands-on experience through 16 Python programming assignments: 

- Build and train neural networks using TensorFlow

- Improve your networkâ€™s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images

- Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems

- Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and train a model to create original poetry!
